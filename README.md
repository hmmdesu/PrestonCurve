# PrestonCurve
Independent R project illustrating the Preston Curve
This project is to practise the R programming language. I decided to look at the relationship between GDP and Life expectancy. It is a relationship that I understand because of my masters.  I have also wrote an essay exploring this. 
I ifgured it would be good to look at something I know so the focus is on using the code rather than the outcome of the data analysis. 

How could I improve this code, because I know it needs work
Feedback welcome!
